    name: "Star Jump",
    type: "Cardio",
    description:
      "An exercise with the name of “star jumps” doesn’t sound particularly menacing, but don’t let that fool you. This plyometric move is essentially a jacked-up, way more intense jumping jack. Start in a quarter squat position with your back flat, feet together, and palms touching the sides of your lower legs. Jump up, raising your arms and legs out to your sides (your body should form an “X” in mid-air). Land softly with your feet together and immediately lower yourself back into the starting position.",

      "Although you’ll work your core with almost all of these strength exercises, a targeted ab move doesn’t hurt. Lie on your back and bring your legs to a tabletop position. Bend your elbows, and put your hands behind your head. Crunch up and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg. Release the crunch slightly. Bend your right leg and straighten your left leg, then bring your left elbow to your right knee. Repeat for the desired number of reps.",

    description:
      "Climbing a mountain would be a daunting workout to most, but what if the mountain is the floor? That's the concept behind mountain climbers. Get into a plank position, making sure to distribute your weight evenly between your hands and your toes. Check your form— your hands should be about shoulder-width apart, back flat, abs engaged, and head in alignment. Pull your right knee into your chest as far as you can. Switch legs, pulling one knee out and bringing the other knee in. Keep your hips down and run your knees in and out as far and as fast as you can. Alternate inhaling and exhaling with each leg change.",

    name: "Chair Tricep Dip",
    type: "Arms",
    description:
      "Chair dips target the muscles on the back of the upper arms. An added benefit to this exercise is that they cane be done safely at home. To try this exercise at home, you first need to find a sturdy chair or bench. A staircase or other stable elevated surface may also work in a pinch. Sit on your chair or bench with your arms at your side and your feet flat on the floor, hip distance apart. Position your hands so that your palms are down beside your hips. Your fingers should grip the front of the chair seat. Move your torso forward off the chair with your arms extended. Your buttocks should hover over the floor and your knees should be slightly bent. Your heels should touch the floor a few inches in front of your knees. Breathe in as you slowly lower your body, hinging at the elbows until each forms a 90-degree angle. Breathe out as you push up to your starting position with your arms fully extended.",
